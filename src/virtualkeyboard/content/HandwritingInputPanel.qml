    \brief Provides a handwriting panel add-on for the virtual keyboard UI.
    \ingroup qtvirtualkeyboard-qml

    The HandwritingInputPanel is an add-on component for the InputPanel, which
    enables full-screen handwriting input for the application.

    HandwritingInputPanel is designed to be anchored full screen alongside
    the InputPanel. The operating principle is that when the handwriting panel
    is "available", the InputPanel is invisible. This functionality is built-in,
    and requires no more than a reference to the InputPanel instance.

    The panel is set into operation by setting the \l {HandwritingInputPanel::}{available}
    property to \c true. When the panel is in operation, the keyboard remains hidden
    when the input focus is set. When \c available is \c true, handwriting input is
    activated by setting the \l {HandwritingInputPanel::}{active} property to \c true.

    The user interface, which provides controls for handwriting mode and the
    visibility of the keyboard, is application-specific. One suggested implementation
    is to use a floating button on the handwriting panel, where single click toggles
    the handwriting mode (changes the \l {HandwritingInputPanel::}{active} property), and double-click toggles
    the visibility of the keyboard (changes the \l {HandwritingInputPanel::}{available} property).

    HandwritingInputPanel also provides a word candidate popup which allows the user
    to select an alternative word candidate from the list of suggestions generated
    by the handwriting input method.

        Setting the property to \c true activates the handwriting input method. When the

        handwriting input panel and redirected to input engine for processing.
