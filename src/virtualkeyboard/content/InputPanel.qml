    \brief Provides the virtual keyboard UI.
    \ingroup qtvirtualkeyboard-qml

    The keyboard size is automatically calculated from the available
    width; that is, the keyboard maintains the aspect ratio specified by the current
    style. Therefore the application should only set the \l {Item::}{width} and \l {Item::}{y}
    coordinates of the InputPanel, and not the \l {Item::}{height}.

    As with \l {Qt Virtual Keyboard QML Types}{all other QML types} provided by
    the module, the \c QT_IM_MODULE environment variable must be set to
    \c qtvirtualkeyboard before using InputPanel. For more information, see
    \l {Loading the Plugin}.

    /*!
        \qmlproperty bool InputPanel::active
        \since QtQuick.VirtualKeyboard 2.0

        This property reflects the active status of the input panel.
        The keyboard should be made visible to the user when this property is
        \c true.

    property alias active: keyboard.active

    /*!
        \qmlproperty bool InputPanel::externalLanguageSwitchEnabled
        \since QtQuick.VirtualKeyboard 2.4

        This property enables the external language switch mechanism.
        When this property is \c true, the virtual keyboard will not show
        the built-in language popup, but will emit the \l externalLanguageSwitch
        signal instead. The application can handle this signal and show a
        custom language selection dialog instead.
    */
    property bool externalLanguageSwitchEnabled

    /*!
        \qmlsignal InputPanel::externalLanguageSwitch(var localeList, int currentIndex)
        \since QtQuick.VirtualKeyboard 2.4

        This signal is emitted when \l externalLanguageSwitchEnabled is \c true
        and the \l {user-guide-language}{language switch key} is pressed by the user.

        It serves as a hook to display a custom language dialog instead of
        the built-in language popup in the virtual keyboard.

        The \a localeList parameter contains a list of locale names to choose
        from. To get more information about a particular language, use the \l Qt.locale()
        function. The \a currentIndex is the index of current locale in the
        \a localeList. This item should be highlighted as the current item in the UI.

        To select a new language, use the \l {VirtualKeyboardSettings::locale}
        {VirtualKeyboardSettings.locale} property.

        Below is an example that demonstrates a custom language dialog implementation:

        \snippet qtvirtualkeyboard-custom-language-popup.qml popup

        The dialog would then be declared:

        \snippet qtvirtualkeyboard-custom-language-popup.qml declaring

        In the application's InputPanel, add the following code:

        \snippet qtvirtualkeyboard-custom-language-popup.qml using

        The custom dialog will now be shown when the language switch key is pressed.
