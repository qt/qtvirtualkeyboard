    \brief Generic mode key for keyboard layouts.

    This key provides generic mode button functionality.

    A key press toggles the current mode without emitting key event
    for input method processing.

    ModeKey can be used in situations where a particular mode is switched
    "ON / OFF", and where the mode change does not require changing the
    keyboard layout. When this component is used, the \l { BaseKey::displayText } { displayText } should
    remain the same regardless of the mode, because the keyboard style
    visualizes the status.
