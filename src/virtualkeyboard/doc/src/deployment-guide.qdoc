\title Deployment Guide

\section1 Overview

This document describes how to deploy and use the Qt Virtual Keyboard plugin
with Qt 5 applications.

\section1 Deployment

The Qt Virtual Keyboard plugin must be properly deployed before it can be used.
The easiest approach to deployment is to add a deployment step
in Qt Creator that executes the \c {make install} command.

\c {make install} deploys the files in the following locations:

\table
\header
    \li Item
    \li Desktop install path
    \li Boot2Qt install path
\row
    \li qtvirtualkeyboardplugin
    \li \c $$[QT_INSTALL_PLUGINS]/platforminputcontexts
    \li \c /system/plugins/platforminputcontexts
\row
    \li qtvirtualkeyboardplugin QML files
    \li \c $$[QT_INSTALL_QML]/QtQuick/Enterprise/VirtualKeyboard
    \li \c /system/qml/QtQuick/Enterprise/VirtualKeyboard
\row
    \li qtvirtualkeyboardstylesplugin
    \li \c $$[QT_INSTALL_QML]/QtQuick/Enterprise/VirtualKeyboard/Styles
    \li \c /system/qml/QtQuick/Enterprise/VirtualKeyboard/Styles
\endtable

\section1 Integration Method

Qt Virtual Keyboard currently supports two alternative integration methods
for using the plugin:

\list
    \li \c Desktop: Qt Virtual Keyboard is integrated with Qt 5 and requires no
        changes to existing applications. The Qt Virtual Keyboard input method
        is available to all of the Qt 5 applications in the system.
    \li \c Application: Qt Virtual Keyboard is integrated with Qt 5, but
        requires changes to particular applications using Qt Virtual Keyboard.
        This method is mandatory in a Boot2Qt environment, but can be used in
        desktop applications too.
\endlist

The integration method is automatically selected by the project files.
However, in desktop environments, it is possible to override the desktop
integration method and use the application integration method instead.
This happens by adding the \c CONFIG+=disable-desktop to the \c qmake
command line.

\note The desktop integration method is not currently available in Boot2Qt
environments.

\section1 Loading the Plugin

In both integration methods, the application must use the \c QT_IM_MODULE
environment variable to load the plugin. For example:

\code
$ QT_IM_MODULE=qtvirtualkeyboard myapp
\endcode

or in the main() function:

\code
qputenv("QT_IM_MODULE", QByteArray("qtvirtualkeyboard"));
\endcode

In the desktop integration method, this step is all that is required to
use Qt Virtual Keyboard. In the application integration method, the application
is required to create an instance of InputPanel as explained in the
following chapter.

\section1 Creating InputPanel

The following example shows how to create an InputPanel and how to
divide the screen area with the application container.

\code
import QtQuick 2.0
import QtQuick.Enterprise.VirtualKeyboard 1.3

Item {
    id: root
    Item {
        id: appContainer
        anchors.left: parent.left
        anchors.top: parent.top
        anchors.right: parent.right
        anchors.bottom: inputPanel.top
        ...
    }
    InputPanel {
        id: inputPanel
        y: Qt.inputMethod.visible ? parent.height - inputPanel.height : parent.height
        anchors.left: parent.left
        anchors.right: parent.right
    }
}
\endcode

The input panel must be a sibling element next to the application container.
It is important not to put the input panel within the application container,
as it would then overlap with the contents of the application. Also, the
input panel height will be automatically updated according to the available
width; the aspect ratio of the input panel is constant.

If the application contains Flickable elements, they will be automatically
scrolled to the focused element.
