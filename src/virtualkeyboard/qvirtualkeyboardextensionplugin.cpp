    \brief Extension plugin for the Qt Virtual Keyboard.

    Extension plugin allows customizing and extending the Qt Virtual Keyboard
    functionality. Extension plugin can provide additional keyboard layouts and
    input methods.

    Virtual keyboard loads all the extension plugins at startup. It searches for
    \c plugins/virtualkeyboard directory and matches the metadata found in the
    plugin. If there are two or more extension plugins with the same \c Name, it
    loads the one with the highest \c Version number.

/*!
    If the plugin metadata contains \c InputMethod field defining an input method
    name, Qt Virtual Keyboard will call registerTypes() for registering the input
    method as QML type. The type must be registered with a \a uri if the input method
    is used by the default keyboard layouts. If the input method type is only used in
    private layouts (known only by the plugin), the uri can be omitted and chosen
    freely.
