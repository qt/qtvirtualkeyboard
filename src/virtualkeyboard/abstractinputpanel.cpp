    Input panel is a container for InputPanel qml view.

    The virtual keyboard currently supports the following input panels:
    \list
        \li AppInputPanel Input panel type that is integrated directly into the
            application.
        \li DesktopInputPanel Input panel type for Desktop systems.
    \endlist

    constructed by the AbstractInputPanel::createView() method.
